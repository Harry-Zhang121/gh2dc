# GH2DC

This project uses a Cloudflare Worker to create an AI-generated summary of a GitHub repositoryâ€™s README, then sends it to a Discord channel vis webhook.

## Usage
1. After cloning the repository, set your environment variables (e.g., OPENROUTER_API_KEY, DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL).
2. Run `npx wrangler dev` locally and navigate to the provided URL, appending a GitHub repo URL path.

## Example
If your worker is deployed at `https://gh2dc.worker.dev`, you can use it like this:
`https://gh2dc.worker.dev/https://github.com/username/repository`

This will create an AI summary of the repository's README and send it to your configured Discord channel.


## Deployment
1. Install Wrangler and configure your Cloudflare account.
2. Run `npx wrangler publish` to deploy your own version of this worker under your Cloudflare account.
